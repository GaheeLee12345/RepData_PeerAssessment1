This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



You can also embed plots, for example:


```
## [1] "LC_COLLATE=English_United States.1252;LC_CTYPE=English_United States.1252;LC_MONETARY=English_United States.1252;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=English_United States.1252"
```

```
## [1] "The mean steps per day is:  37.3825995807128"
```

```
## [1] "The median steps per day is:  0"
```

```
## [1] "The maximum number of steps in a five minute interval was:  206.169811320755"
```

```
## [1] "There are 2304 missing data points."
```

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
